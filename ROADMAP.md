# Logging Module Roadmap
- [ ] **ILogger Interface**
  - [ ] Create `ILogger` interface with common logging methods (`debug`, `log`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `critical`, `security`, ...)

- [ ] **LoggerFactory**
  - [ ] Implement `LoggerFactory` to instantiate and return logger instances
  - [ ] Ensure `LoggerFactory` can accept configuration to choose the appropriate logger implementation

- [ ] **Logger Config**
  - [ ] Develop a `LoggerConfig` class to handle external configuration loading
  - [ ] Include methods to read configurations from environment variables or files

- [ ] **WinstonLogger Strategy**
  - [ ] Implement `WinstonLogger` class adhering to the `ILogger` interface
  - [ ] Write unit tests for `WinstonLogger` to test logging functionality

- [ ] **Winston Adapter**
  - [ ] Create `WinstonAdapter` to translate generic log calls to winston-specific methods
  - [ ] Write unit tests for `WinstonAdapter` to ensure correct interfacing with winston

- [ ] **Logging Middleware**
  - [ ] Write `LoggingMiddleware` for Express to inject trace IDs
  - [ ] Ensure `LoggingMiddleware` adds trace ID to logger's context
  - [ ] Generate unit tests for middleware to confirm trace ID generation and assignment

- [ ] **RequestContext Manager**
  - [ ] Define `RequestContext` class to allow propagation of context across async calls
  - [ ] Ensure context includes trace ID and any other necessary data
  - [ ] Write tests to ensure context is maintained throughout the lifecycle of a request

- [ ] **LogMessageQueue**
  - [ ] Design `LogMessageQueue` to manage asynchronous message handling with proper timestamps
  - [ ] Implement a queuing mechanism to ensure message order is preserved
  - [ ] Create unit tests to validate asynchronous behavior and order correctness

# User-Friendly and Scalable Test-First Development

- [ ] *For each component, start with writing unit tests:*
    - [ ] Test common happy flow scenarios
    - [ ] Test edge cases and error handling

- [ ] *Iterative enhancement:*
    - [ ] Refine features based on test results
    - [ ] Refactor tests as needed when adjusting architecture or component APIs

- [ ] *Documentation:*
    - [ ] Document each componentâ€™s responsibilities
    - [ ] Provide usage examples within test cases
    - [ ] Ensure clear error messages and debugging information are outputted by the tests

- [ ] *Scalability focus:*
    - [ ] Evaluate performance implications in tests
    - [ ] Design components with future adapters and strategies in mind

- [ ] *Integration tests:*
    - [ ] Set up a simulated Express application environment for middleware testing
    - [ ] Ensure logs with trace IDs can be followed through a request's entire flow

- [ ] *Review and polish:*
    - [ ] Conduct code reviews focusing on maintainability and scalability
    - [ ] Test the ease of configuration and extension of the logging module
    - [ ] Validate that logs output in development and production modes meet requirements
