# Implement Scalable and Configurable Logging Module using Winston
We are initiating the development of a scalable logging module that leverages Winston for its underlying logging functionality. This module should be tailored to meet the asynchronous logging needs with accurate timestamps and seamless integration into an Express application with complete traceability through a request's lifecycle.

## File structure
```

  /adapters
    - WinstonAdapter.ts
    /__tests__
      - WinstonAdapter.test.ts
  /strategies
    - WinstonLogger.ts
    /__tests__
      - WinstonLogger.test.ts
  /middleware
    - LoggingMiddleware.ts
    /__tests__
      - LoggingMiddleware.test.ts

    - LogMessageQueue.ts
    /__tests__
      - LogMessageQueue.test.ts
  - ILogger.ts
  - LoggerFactory.ts
  - LoggerConfig.ts
  /__tests__
    - LoggerFactory.test.ts
    - LoggerConfig.test.ts
  - index.ts
```

## Responsibilities:
- **ILogger.ts**: Interface defining standardized logging methods.
- **LoggerFactory.ts**: Component responsible for instantiating and providing logger instances based on configuration.
- **LoggerConfig.ts**: Handles retrieval and parsing of external configuration data for loggers.
- **index.ts**: The entry point for the module that exports the necessary API.

### Directories and files
- **/adapters/WinstonAdapter.ts**: Adapter for translating calls from the ILogger interface to Winston's logging methods.
- **/strategies/WinstonLogger.ts**: The concrete implementation of ILogger that interacts with the Winston logging library.
- **/middleware/LoggingMiddleware.ts**: Express middleware responsible for generating and attaching trace IDs to requests.
- **/context/RequestContext.ts**: Manages propagation of the trace ID and other request-specific data throughout the application.
- **/queue/LogMessageQueue.ts**: Processes asynchronous log messages while preserving their order and timestamps.

### Acceptance criteria
- [x] ILogger interface has methods implemented for various logging levels and is easily extensible.
- [x] LoggerConfig supports reading from environment variables and/or configuration files with fallback defaults.
- [x] LoggerFactory creates and returns logger instances appropriately per the provided configuration.
- [ ] WinstonAdapter ensures that any ILogger method call correctly interacts with the Winston logger.
- [ ] WinstonLogger implements the ILogger interface and delegates log operations to Winston properly.
- [ ] LoggingMiddleware generates a trace ID for each request, ensures each log message includes this ID, and all logs are associated with the request lifecycle.
- [ ] RequestContext maintains trace ID and any other request-related data across asynchronous calls and is accessible throughout the application.
- [ ] LogMessageQueue handles log messages asynchronicity without blocking the main thread and retains log order with accurate timestamps.
- [ ] Unit tests for all components are passing, covering happy paths, edge cases, and potential error conditions.
- [ ] Integration tests validate that the module is fully functional within an Express application context.
- [ ] Documentation provided for each component explains its design, usage, and potential interactions with other components.
- [ ] Performance testing confirms minimal impact on application response times.
- [ ] The API is intuitive to use, and the module can be easily integrated or replaced within different application architectures.

#### Additional Notes
Developers should ensure all components are developed with SOLID principles in mind, particularly focusing on single responsibility and dependency inversion. Tests must ensure the easy configurability of the logging module and verify its scalability and performance under load.

## Tackling order
1. ILogger Interface: The foundation of our logging module, it defines the contract all logging strategies must adhere to.
 - Start by defining test cases (ILogger.test.ts) for the expected methods and behaviors of loggers.
 - Implement the ILogger TypeScript interface (ILogger.ts) to pass these tests.

2. Logger Configuration:
 - Write tests for loading and parsing configuration (LoggerConfig.test.ts).
 - Create the LoggerConfig class (LoggerConfig.ts) that will be used to configure the logging strategy from external sources.

3. Winston Adapter:
 - Begin writing the tests for the Winston adapter (WinstonAdapter.test.ts), asserting that it correctly translates ILogger interface calls to Winston-specific API calls.
 - Implement the Winston adapter (WinstonAdapter.ts) based on those tests.

4. Winston Logger Strategy:
 - Define tests for the WinstonLogger strategy (WinstonLogger.test.ts) that check if the log methods behave as expected when called.
 - Code the WinstonLogger class (WinstonLogger.ts) as per the test specifications.

5. Logger Factory:
 - Develop tests for the LoggerFactory (LoggerFactory.test.ts), verifying that it correctly instantiates the desired logger based on configuration.
 - Implement the LoggerFactory (LoggerFactory.ts).

6. Request Context:
 - Write tests that ensure the RequestContext (RequestContext.test.ts) can maintain and propagate trace IDs and other context data across async operations.
 - Implement the RequestContext class (RequestContext.ts).

7. Logging Middleware:
 - Craft tests to ensure the LoggingMiddleware (LoggingMiddleware.test.ts) adds a trace ID to every request and that this ID permeates through all subsequent logging calls.
 - Implement the middleware (LoggingMiddleware.ts).

8. Log Message Queue:
 - Develop tests (LogMessageQueue.test.ts) to make sure the message queue handles asynchronous logging without losing the sequence of log messages.
 - Build the LogMessageQueue module (LogMessageQueue.ts).

### How to Proceed with TDD:
For each component, follow the "Red-Green-Refactor" workflow:
- Start with a failing test (Red).
- Write just enough code to make the test pass (Green).
- Refine the code while keeping the test green (Refactor).
- Move to the next component and repeat.
