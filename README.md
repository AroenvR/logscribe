# MERMAID

### Overview
Class diagrams are a type of static structure diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that describe the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects. Mermaid can render class diagrams to visualize these elements.

#### Basic Syntax
To create a class diagram, use the following structure in a mermaid code block:
```mermaid
---
title: Diagram Title
---
classDiagram
    Animal <|-- Duck
```

Key Components
- Classes: Represent entities in a system.
- Attributes: Characteristics of classes.
- Methods: Operations that the classes can perform.
- Relationships: Connections between classes (e.g., inheritance, aggregation).

#### Example
```mermaid
---
title: Animal Example
---
classDiagram
    note "From Duck till Zebra"
    Animal <|-- Duck
    note for Duck "can fly\ncan swim\ncan dive\ncan help in debugging"
    Animal <|-- Fish
    Animal <|-- Zebra
    Animal : +int age
    Animal : +String gender
    Animal: +isMammal()
    Animal: +mate()
    class Duck {
        +String beakColor
        +swim()
        +quack()
    }
    class Fish {
        -int sizeInFeet
        -canEat()
    }
    class Zebra {
        +bool is_wild
        +run()
    }
```

#### Defining Classes
Two Ways to Define a Class
1. Explicitly Using the Keyword class:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal
```
2. Via a Relationship:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    Vehicle <|-- Car
```

#### Naming Convention
A class name should consist only of alphanumeric characters (including unicode), underscores (_), and dashes (-).

### Class Members
Defining Members of a Class UML represents class members such as attributes and methods through the following methods:

Individual Member Definition using the Colon (:):
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BankAccount
    BankAccount : +String owner
```

Grouped Member Definition Using Braces ({}):
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BankAccount {
        +String owner
        +BigDecimal balance
    }
```

### Member Visibility
To describe the visibility of an attribute or method:
- \+ Public
- \- Private
- \# Protected
- ~ Package/Internal

### Return Type
You can specify an optional return type for methods:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BankAccount {
        +deposit(amount) bool
    }
```

### Generics
Generics can be represented using the tilde (~):
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Square~Shape~ {
        int id
        List~int~ position
        setPoints(List~int~ points)
        getPoints() List~int~
    }
```

### Relationships
The following relationship types are supported:
- Inheritance: <|--
- Composition: *--
- Aggregation: o--
- Association: -->
- Dependency: ..>
- Realization: ..|>

And Link can be one of:
- Solid: --
- Dashed: ..

#### Example Relationships
```mermaid
classDiagram
    %% Inheritance
    class Animal
    class Dog
    Animal <|-- Dog : Inheritance

    %% Composition
    class House
    class Room
    House *-- Room : Composition

    %% Aggregation
    class Team
    class Player
    Team o-- Player : Aggregation

    %% Association
    class Student
    class Course
    Student --> Course : Association

    %% Dependency
    class Car
    class Engine
    Car ..> Engine : Dependency

    %% Realization
    class IPayment
    class PaymentProcessor
    PaymentProcessor ..|> IPayment : Realization

    %% Solid Link (may not represent standard UML relationship)
    class ClassA
    class ClassB
    ClassA -- ClassB : Link(Solid)

    %% Dashed Link (may not represent standard UML relationship)
    class ClassC
    class ClassD
    ClassC .. ClassD : Link(Dashed)
```

1. Inheritance (<|--)  
**Meaning**: Represents a hierarchical relationship between a superclass (parent) and a subclass (child). The subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass.  
**When to Use**: Use inheritance when creating a specialized version of a class that retains the properties and behaviors of a more general class. It's suitable for modeling "is-a" relationships (e.g., a Dog is an Animal).

2. Composition (*--)  
**Meaning**: Denotes a strong ownership relationship where a part (child) cannot exist independently of the whole (parent). If the parent is destroyed, so are its children.  
**When to Use**: Use composition when a class is made up of one or more parts that are tightly coupled to the parent class. It illustrates strong containment (e.g., a House contains Rooms).

3. Aggregation (o--)  
**Meaning**: Represents a weak ownership relationship where a part can exist independently of the whole. The part can belong to multiple wholes.  
**When to Use**: Use aggregation when modeling relationships where a class contains references to other classes, but those classes can exist independently. It signifies a "has-a" relationship (e.g., a Team has Players, but players can exist outside the team).

4. Association (-->)  
**Meaning**: Indicates a general relationship between two classes, where one object connects to another, typically involving navigation from one to the other.  
**When to Use**: Use association for general relationships between classes without ownership. It can represent various relationships where both objects can exist independently (e.g., a Student and a Course might be associated, with students enrolling in courses).

5. Dependency (..>)  
**Meaning**: Signifies a relationship where one class (the client) depends on another class (the supplier) for its functionality. Changes in the supplier may affect the client.  
**When to Use**: Use dependency when a class relies on another class for its operations, especially in scenarios where the dependency is temporary or subject to change (e.g., a Car class might depend on an Engine class).

6. Realization (..|>)  
**Meaning**: Represents a relationship between an interface and a class that implements the interface. The implementing class agrees to fulfill the behavior defined by the interface.  
**When to Use**: Use realization when a class provides the implementation for an interfaceâ€™s specified methods. This is relevant in scenarios involving polymorphism or when defining service contracts (e.g., a PaymentProcessor class realizes the IPayment interface).

### Multiplicity
Multiplicity indicates the number of instances of one class that can be associated with another:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    Customer "1" --> "*" Ticket
```

### Annotations
Annotations provide additional metadata about a class. Add annotations using double angle brackets <<>>:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Shape {
        <<interface>>
        +draw()
    }
```

### Comments
Comments in a class diagram can be added by preceding the line with %%:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    %% This is a comment line
    class Shape {
        +draw()
    }
```

### Action Binding
You can bind click events to nodes:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Shape
    click Shape href "https://example.com" "This is a tooltip"
```

### Styling Nodes
You can apply styles to specific nodes:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal
    style Animal fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```
